This repository contains a minimal Discord bot scaffold using discord.js v14.

Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

Notes

- The bot registers a `/ping` command. During development set `GUILD_ID` in the `.env` to register commands instantly to a test server. Without `GUILD_ID` commands are registered globally and can take up to an hour to appear.
- Node.js 18+ is recommended.
